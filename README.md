# Hierarchical-Clustering
Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.


Problem Statement:
1.)	Perform clustering for the airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters. Draw the inferences from the clusters obtained. Refer to EastWestAirlines.xlsx dataset.

Problem Statement:
2.)	Perform clustering for the crime data and identify the number of clusters formed and draw inferences. Refer to crime_data.csv dataset

Problem Statement:
3.)	Perform clustering analysis on the telecom data set. The data is a mixture of both categorical and numerical data. It consists the number of customers who churn. Derive insights and get possible information on factors that may affect the churn decision. Refer to Telco_customer_churn.xlsx dataset.
Hint: 
•	Perform EDA and remove unwanted columns.
•	Use Gower dissimilarity matrix, In R use daisy() function.
