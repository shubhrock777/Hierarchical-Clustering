# Hierarchical-Clustering
Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.


Problem Statement:
1.)	Perform clustering for the airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters. Draw the inferences from the clusters obtained. Refer to EastWestAirlines.xlsx dataset.

Problem Statement:
2.)	Perform clustering for the crime data and identify the number of clusters formed and draw inferences. Refer to crime_data.csv dataset
